Welcome! If you've stumbled across this page it means you either want to contribute to the SDK in some way or the Wiki. For either option, read the information below to get started!

## Contributing to the Wiki
Unfortunately as of currently, GitHub doesn't provide a way for users to collaborate on wiki pages within a Repository without any sort of moderation. So as of this point, nobody is able to contribute to the wikipedia. 

However, there is a current workaround. If you'd like to contribute by clearing up some information, or by adding a new page - you can do so by opening either a [Wiki New Page](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Wiki&projects=&template=wiki_page.yaml&title=%5BWiki+New+Page%5D%3A+) or [Wiki Update](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Wiki&projects=&template=wiki_update.yaml&title=%5BWiki+Update%5D%3A+) issue template. Once doing so, fill out the information required in the template then the wikipedia can be updated accordingly.

## Contributing to the SDK
When it comes to contributing to the SDK there are viable options here as there is moderation. Before contributing to the SDK there is a process you should follow as outlined below...

### Step 1: Preparing the SDK
First, you'll need to setup this SDK somewhere on your computer. By following the steps below it'll teach you how.

- Begin by creating a fork from this repository by selecting the `Fork` button on GitHub in the top right.
- Secondly, clone your newly forked repository to somewhere on your computer.
- Then run through the [Unity Setup](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/wiki/Unity-Setup) if you haven't done so already. But instead of installing the SDK via `Add package from git URL...` do it from the `Install package from disk...` and select the `package.json` file from your cloned fork.

### Step 2: Creating or Finding an Issue
In this step this is where you can choose between finding an existing feature request or bug report and fix them, or creating your own feature request or bug report and fixing those. While this step isn't necessarily _needed_ it's highly recommended as it's provides insights into what feature / bug you are working on.

- Begin either looking through all the [Issues](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/issues) and choosing a feature request to fulfil or a bug report to fix. Or open your own [Feature Request](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+Request%2CSDK&projects=&template=feature_request.yaml&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D%3A+) or [Bug Report](https://github.com/Deaadman/ModComponentSDK/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug+Report%2CSDK&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml&title=%5BBug+Report%5D%3A+) templates in [Issues](https://github.com/Deaadman/ModComponentSDK/issues) to then tackle yourself.
- If you are creating a new [Feature Request](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+Request%2CSDK&projects=&template=feature_request.yaml&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D%3A+) or [Bug Report](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug+Report%2CSDK&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml&title=%5BBug+Report%5D%3A+) then ensure to fill out the required details by the template, as it will help others understand what your goal is.

### Step 3: Create a Branch
After choosing one of the options above, it's necessary to make a branch from your forked repository. This is to ensure no direct changes are made to the [develop](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/tree/develop) branch which might end up breaking something.

- Begin by creating a branch, it's necessary to use a name that easily describes the feature or bug you are working on. Keep it clean and simple for everyone to understand, but you'll be referring this branch back to the issue you created or chose earlier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's also important to separate your branches for each feature or bug you are working on. **DON'T** work on multiple features and bugs in one branch.

### Step 4: Committing Changes
After coding new functionality or fixing bugs, remember to commit your changes as you go. These can be seen as a 'saving' point for each point in your coding timeline. While making commits, make sure they follow the standard below:

- Make sure commit messages are clear and concise that explain any changes made.

### Step 5: Testing Changes
Once you have either added the feature or fixed a bug, it's important to test your changing in order to make sure nothing else has been affected in the process. While there isn't really a process towards checking certain things, it's good practice.

### Step 6: Submitting a Pull Request
Finally, after all the following steps are completed - you can finally make a pull request for these changes to be merged into the official SDK. Once doing so, you will be added to the contributors list with what you have contributed to the SDK. Follow the steps below in order to ensure a successful pull request.

- Begin by pushing your branch(s) to your forked repository on GitHub.
- From there, submit a pull request to the [develop](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/tree/develop) branch of this SDK.
- As you are submitting your pull request. You need to describe the changes, link to the related issue you have either chosen or opened, and mention any important considerations or steps required for testing.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure it is the [**develop**](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk/tree/develop) branch and **NOT** the [**main**](https://github.com/Deaadman/mod-component-sdk) branch.

> [!NOTE]
> Once the pull request is checked and tested by someone, and something doesn't add up. They will get back to you in your pull request letting you know why they haven't merged it in, and what changes you need to make in order for them to be.

Congratulations! You have officially contributed to the SDK! Now sit back, relax and wait for it to be pulled into the main repository.
